# Deforgify


## 💡 Inspiration
Deep learning has had a lot of success with Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) in recent times which are used to generate high-quality outputs that are comparable to the original inputs. GANs have been widely utilised to create new realistic pictures and to improve existing ones. On the other hand, GANs may be used to fool individuals by generating false data. Fake faces made by GANs, for example, may deceive not only humans but also machine learning classifiers. Synthetic photographs for identification and authentication purposes, for example, can be used maliciously.

Furthermore, advanced picture editing software such as Adobe Photoshop allows for the alteration of complicated input photographs as well as the creation of high-quality new images. These techniques have improved to the point that they can now build realistic and intricate false pictures that are difficult to distinguish from the genuine thing. YouTube has step-by-step directions and tutorials for making these sorts of fictitious graphics. As a result, these technologies have the potential to be utilised for defamation, impersonation, and factual distortion. Furthermore, with social media, fraudulent material may be swiftly and extensively shared on the Internet.
